"""mdzip_diff.py - semantic diff between two MagicDraw/Cameo .mdzip files.

The problem: mdzip is XML whose xmi:ids churn (every save reorders members,
delta snapshots duplicate subtrees, TeamworkCloud rewrites every element's
server id).  String/XML diffs are noise.  The fix is to diff the MODEL, not
the bytes:

  1. import both files with mdzip_import (ids normalized away);
  2. flatten each to element records: (metaclass, qualified path, features);
  3. match records across versions:
       a. exact qualified-path match,
       b. same metaclass + name with a moved owner (move detection),
       c. same metaclass, same owner, name-changed (rename detection),
       d. remaining unmatched: one-to-one pairing by feature similarity
          (Jaccard over (feature, value) pairs) above a threshold;
  4. diff matched pairs feature-by-feature (human-readable rows);
  5. report added / removed / renamed / moved / changed / unchanged counts
     plus the per-element feature deltas.

xmi:id never participates in matching.  Designed to survive TeamworkCloud
re-saves (server IDs change wholesale) and Cameo delta-snapshot churn.
